                    <Here Term> ~ <Here Definition>
                    <Here Term> ~ <Here Definition>

                    and also don't say this is the term this is the defination, nothing from you
                    Below the thing that is striped by ``` ```is the text you are going to process and also all the texts after this are the things you are going to process and generate flashcards and also as I said don't say anything at the start or at the end no extra things other than the flashcard like Here are the flashcards:, Here is this this this, I don't want anything like that, only the flash cards
